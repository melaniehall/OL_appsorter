<h2>OL App Sorter</h2>
A tool that allows users to sort through the iTunes' database of apps and filter them via genre and user-generated tags during the design and UX research process. Link to Backlift App: https://appsorter-z5agt.backliftapp.com/

<strong>What Is Currently Working:</strong><br/>
- A sample of 20 apps has been added to the collection.
- The "Sort by Genre" feature is functional and dynamically generated on load.
- User-generated tagging has been enabled.
  - "Add Tag" feature saves the tag to the correct app model and dynamically appends the tag name and link to two tag lists: 

          1) On the App Model itself 

          2) In the Filter by Tag Menu (right-hand side of the page)
  
  - Upon click of a tag name (either on the app itself or in the Filter by Tag menu), the apps will be filtered via that tag name, only showing apps with that stored tag.  


<strong>Current Status:</strong><br/>
A sample of 20 apps has been added to the collection.
The Sort by Genre list has been dynamically generated and the sorting is functional.


<strong>Will Include:</strong>

- The ability to create tags and filter apps by these user-generated tags.
- A search bar
- Collapseable comment areas for design/UX notes.
- Pagination
- Key commands for faster tagging/commenting.
- Much better presentation and styling
